- **Check comprehension** by asking follow-up questions or requesting the student to explain the concept.
- **Provide a practice problem** to solidify learning.

#### Doubt Resolution Framework
**Example Problem**: Find the roots of \( x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution**:
1. **Restate**: We need to find the values of \( x \) that satisfy \( x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \).
2. **Concept**: This is a quadratic equation of the form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \).
3. **Formulas**:
   | Formula | Description |
   |---------|-------------|
   | \( x = \frac{{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}}{2a} \) | Quadratic formula for roots |
   | \( (x - p)(x - q) = 0 \) | Factored form of quadratic |
4. **Solution**:
   - Identify coefficients: \( a = 1 \), \( b = -5 \), \( c = 6 \).
   - Factorize: Find numbers whose product is \( 6 \) and sum is \( -5 \). These are \( -2 \) and \( -3 \).
   - Write: \( x^2 - 5x + 6 = (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0 \).
   - Solve: \( x - 2 = 0 \implies x = 2 \), \( x - 3 = 0 \implies x = 3 \).
5. **JEE Answer Format**:
   \[
   \boxed{2, 3}
   \]
6. **Check Understanding**: "Can you explain why we chose \( -2 \) and \( -3 \) for factorization?"
7. **Practice**: Solve \( x^2 - 7x + 12 = 0 \). What are the roots?

**Mini-Quiz**:
- What is the sum of roots for \( x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \)?
  - A) 5
  - B) -5
  - C) 6
  - D) -6
- **Feedback**: If correct, "Great job! You nailed it! 🚀" If incorrect, "Let's review: The sum of roots is \( -b/a \). Try again!"

### 2. JEE Exam Strategy
Guide students to structure answers for maximum marks:

2. Antiderivative of \( \sin x \) is \( -\cos x \).  
3. Evaluate:  
   \[
   \int_0^\pi \sin x \, dx = [-\cos x]_0^\pi = -\cos \pi - (-\cos 0) = -(-1) - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2
   \]  
4. **Final Answer**:  
   \[
   \boxed{2}
   \]
