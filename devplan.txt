## Backend Development Plan: fynq AI Tutor Platform

This document outlines a 10-step development plan for building the fynq AI Tutor Platform's backend, from initial setup to a production-ready product with integrated frontend.

### Step 1: Project Setup and Core Infrastructure 
*   **1.1. Project Initialization**: Create a new Python project, set up a virtual environment, and install FastAPI.
*   **1.2. Directory Structure**: Establish the recommended FastAPI project structure (e.g., `app/api`, `app/core`, `app/db`, `app/services`).
*   **1.3. Configuration Management**: Implement `config.py` for managing application settings and environment variables (e.g., using Pydantic's `BaseSettings`).
*   **1.4. Supabase Integration**: Connect FastAPI to Supabase PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy. Configure database connection strings.
*   **1.5. Initial Database Models**: Define core database models (e.g., `User`, `Chat`, `Message`) using SQLAlchemy ORM. Focus on essential fields.
*   **1.6. Database Migrations**: Set up Alembic for managing database schema changes. Create initial migration scripts for the defined models.
*   **1.7. Basic API Endpoint**: Create a simple "hello world" endpoint to verify FastAPI is running correctly.

### Step 2: Authentication and User Management 
*   **2.1. Supabase Auth Integration**: Configure FastAPI to work with Supabase's JWTs. Implement a dependency to extract and validate JWTs from incoming requests.
*   **2.2. User Registration & Login**: Create API endpoints (`POST /auth/register`, `POST /auth/login`) that interact with Supabase Auth for user creation and session management.
*   **2.3. User Profile Management**: Develop endpoints (`GET /users/me`, `PUT /users/me`) to retrieve and update user-specific data, ensuring proper authorization.
*   **2.4. Password Hashing**: Ensure all password handling (if any direct password management is done outside Supabase Auth) uses strong hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt).
*   **2.5. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implement basic RBAC using JWT claims from Supabase to restrict access to certain endpoints or data based on user roles.

### Step 3: Gemini API Integration (Core AI Logic) 
*   **3.1. Gemini Service Development**: Create a dedicated `gemini_service.py` within `app/services` to abstract all interactions with the Google Gemini API.
*   **3.2. API Key Management**: Securely manage Gemini API keys using environment variables.
*   **3.3. Request/Response Handling**: Implement functions within `gemini_service` to format requests for Gemini (e.g., text prompts, image inputs) and parse its responses.
*   **3.4. Error Handling & Retries**: Implement robust error handling for Gemini API calls, including retries with exponential backoff for transient network issues or rate limits.
*   **3.5. Initial Chat Integration**: Develop a basic function to send a text message to Gemini and receive a text response.

### Step 4: File Storage and Management 
*   **4.1. Supabase Storage Setup**: Configure Supabase Storage buckets for different file types (e.g., user uploads, content assets).
*   **4.2. File Service Development**: Create a `file_service.py` to handle file operations: uploading, downloading, and deleting files from Supabase Storage.
*   **4.3. File Upload Endpoint**: Implement a FastAPI endpoint (`POST /files/upload`) that accepts file uploads, stores them in Supabase Storage, and returns the public URL.
*   **4.4. Security for File Storage**: Implement Row Level Security (RLS) on Supabase Storage buckets to ensure users can only access their own files or publicly available content.

### Step 5: Chat and Content Management Features 
*   **5.1. Chat Endpoints**: Expand chat endpoints (`POST /api/v1/chat/message`, `POST /api/v1/chat/image`) to handle both text and image-based inputs to Gemini.
*   **5.2. Message Persistence**: Implement logic to save both user messages and AI responses to the `Messages` table, linking them to the correct `Chat` and `User`.
*   **5.3. Chat History**: Develop an endpoint (`GET /api/v1/chat/history/{user_id}`) to retrieve a user's chat history.
*   **5.4. Content Management Service**: Create a `content_service.py` and associated CRUD endpoints for managing educational content (e.g., `GET /content/{id}`, `POST /content`).
*   **5.5. Data Flow Refinement**: Ensure the complete data flow for chat messages, from frontend input, through Gemini processing, to database persistence, is robust and efficient.

### Step 6: Background Tasks and Scalability Considerations 
*   **6.1. Celery Integration**: Set up Celery within the FastAPI project for asynchronous task processing.
*   **6.2. Redis Message Broker**: Configure Redis as the message broker for Celery.
*   **6.3. Task Identification**: Identify specific long-running tasks that can be offloaded to Celery (e.g., complex document parsing, large image analysis for problem solving, pre-computation of AI responses).
*   **6.4. Task Implementation**: Implement at least one example background task to demonstrate Celery's functionality.
*   **6.5. Basic Monitoring for Tasks**: Set up basic logging for Celery tasks to monitor their execution status.

### Step 7: API Design Refinement and Testing 
*   **7.1. API Review & Refinement**: Conduct a thorough review of all API endpoints to ensure adherence to RESTful principles, clear naming conventions, and appropriate HTTP methods.
*   **7.2. Pydantic Validation**: Ensure all incoming request bodies and query parameters are strictly validated using Pydantic models.
*   **7.3. Unit Testing**: Write comprehensive unit tests for all services (`auth_service`, `gemini_service`, `file_service`, `content_service`) and utility functions.
*   **7.4. Integration Testing**: Develop integration tests for API endpoints to ensure proper interaction between services, database, and external APIs.
*   **7.5. Error Handling Standardization**: Implement a consistent error response structure across all API endpoints, providing clear status codes and informative messages.

### Step 8: Security Enhancements 
*   **8.1. Input Validation Reinforcement**: Double-check all input validation to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS.
*   **8.2. Supabase RLS**: Implement and test Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase PostgreSQL to ensure data access is restricted based on user roles and ownership.
*   **8.3. Environment Variable Audit**: Verify all sensitive credentials (API keys, database secrets) are loaded from environment variables and not hardcoded.
*   **8.4. HTTPS Enforcement**: Ensure the deployment environment enforces HTTPS for all traffic.
*   **8.5. CORS Configuration**: Properly configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) headers to allow requests only from trusted frontend origins.
*   **8.6. Rate Limiting**: Implement API rate limiting to protect against abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
*   **8.7. Logging & Monitoring**: Set up detailed logging for security events and integrate with a monitoring system for real-time alerts.

### Step 9: Frontend Integration and Initial Deployment 
*   **9.1. Frontend Collaboration**: Work closely with the frontend development team to integrate the backend APIs. Provide clear API documentation (FastAPI's auto-generated Swagger UI/ReDoc).
*   **9.2. Deployment Preparation**: Prepare the backend codebase for direct deployment. This includes creating a `requirements.txt` file with all dependencies.
*   **9.3. Hosting Environment Setup**: Set up the chosen hosting provider (e.g., Hostinger VPS). Install necessary system dependencies (Python, pip).
*   **9.4. Virtual Environment & Dependencies**: Create a Python virtual environment on the server and install all project dependencies.
*   **9.5. WSGI Server Configuration**: Configure a production-ready WSGI server (e.g., Gunicorn or Uvicorn) to run the FastAPI application.
*   **9.6. Reverse Proxy Setup**: Set up a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx or Apache) to forward public traffic to the WSGI server and handle SSL/TLS.
*   **9.7. Process Management**: Configure a process manager (e.g., `systemd`, `Supervisor`) to ensure the FastAPI application runs continuously and restarts automatically on failure.
*   **9.8. Environment Variable Deployment**: Securely deploy environment variables to the production server.

### Step 10: Monitoring, Optimization, and Future Planning (Ongoing)
*   **10.1. Performance Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive monitoring for backend performance (e.g., response times, error rates, resource utilization) using tools like Prometheus/Grafana or cloud-specific monitoring services.
*   **10.2. Centralized Logging**: Set up centralized logging (e.g., ELK stack, cloud logging services) to aggregate and analyze application logs.
*   **10.3. Error Tracking**: Integrate an error tracking service (e.g., Sentry) to capture and report exceptions in real-time.
*   **10.4. Performance Optimization**: Based on monitoring data, identify and address performance bottlenecks (e.g., optimizing database queries, caching frequently accessed data).
*   **10.5. Advanced AI Features**: Plan and begin implementing more advanced Gemini features (e.g., function calling, multi-turn conversations, more complex multimodal inputs).
*   **10.6. Personalized Learning Paths**: Develop logic for adaptive learning paths based on user progress and performance.
*   **10.7. Analytics & Reporting**: Implement data collection and analytics to gain insights into user behavior and platform usage.
*   **10.8. Real-time Communication**: Explore and implement WebSockets for real-time chat updates or other interactive features.
*   **10.9. Caching Strategy**: Introduce caching layers (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data or Gemini responses to reduce latency and API costs.
*   **10.10. Dockerization & Container Orchestration**: Revisit Dockerization for improved consistency, isolation, and portability, especially as the project scales. Plan for deployment to container orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker Swarm) in the long term.
